# Network Topology Visualization

**Project for the Advanced Network Security course in 2021**

Within this project, the goal is to measure and visualize the network topology for a selected set of host nodes. This way the idea is to get a good overview and understanding of how ASes are connected to each other and how routing agreements influence the paths network traffic takes from source to destination.
